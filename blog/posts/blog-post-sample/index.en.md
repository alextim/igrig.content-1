    The method of transformation of acute mental pain through photo visualization, i.e. the opportunity to see yourself from the outside, a way to return yourself to an active life.
    This time the heartache was unbearable. This is the loss of one's “I”, a “living corpse” performing mechanical movements, this is a restless brain that does not give sleep, not even a second of respite ... The key turn to reviving oneself, the ability to stand on the ruins of one's life was the creation of a photo collage from one's own photographs. On them I am strong, happy and beautiful. I put a photo collage on my laptop's desktop.

    And each time, opening it, I saw from the side of myself the same. Thanks to this, I remembered my true "I"! The rebirth from the ashes has begun ...
    Having experienced such an experience, I wanted to share it, try to visualize acute mental pain: convey it through a photograph, see it from the outside, and thus stimulate recovery, reduce human suffering. The case presented itself. A friend found herself in a critical state of mind, trying to cope with acute pain on her own.

Seeing myself in photo visualization, I fell in love with my imperfection, with myself weak, sensitive and defenseless. Thanks to such an experiment, I love, cherish and pity that Woman, whom I hid in myself for a long time. I cry with her, breathe and live. "
Dedicated to those who once found themselves in a state when the whole world is collapsing around: a loved one leaves, former friends turn away, business collapses, loved ones die. You sink to the very bottom, into the darkness.
